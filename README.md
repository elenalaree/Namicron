## Namicron

# Overview

Being a writer, I like having a name generator that could give me name combinations I might not have thought about. This program offers male or female names and offers the options for first, middle, and last names and any combination of those three is covered. It can save favorite names to local storage and clear local storage.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS code as well as chrome for the tools. I used color verifiers and a favicon maker.

I used Javascript, css, and HTML used on github pages.

# Future Work

- In addition to clearing history, I'd like to have the names have an x on the side so the name can be removed individually.
- I'd like to improve the number of names available.
- Id like to be able to sort names by origin such as 'German', 'Greek', or 'Irish'.
